    <h5 style="margin: 5% 8% 0 8%">Spamming</h5>
    <p style="margin: 2% 8% 2% 8%">Sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial messages over the Internet (known as
        "spamming") is prohibited, regardless of whether or not it overloads a server or disrupts service to Softech's
        customers. The term "spamming" also includes, but is not limited to, maintaining an open SMTP policy, engaging
        in spamming using the service of another ISP or IPP and referencing in the spam a web site hosted on a Softech
        server, and selling or distributing software (on a web site residing on a Softech server) that facilitates
        spamming. Violators will be assessed a minimum fine of Rs.10000 and will face immediate suspension. Softech
        reserves the right to determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, what constitutes a violation of this
        provision.<br>
        Sites that are advertised using SPAM cannot be hosted in our servers.<br>
        Mailing Policy<br>
        The following are the general mailing policy used in Softech servers;<br>
        500 emails can be sent per hour. If you exceed beyond this limit, you will get a bounce back message. If you get
        such errors, please try sending after 1 hour. Number of times you check to the mail server via POP3 / IMAP is
        restricted to 30. If you exceed this, you will get a failed login error. Connecting to mail server once in 10
        min is ideal. Catch all or default mail id must be set to fail. This is to avoid stacking of unnecessary spam
        mails in the server which finally results in large number of inode creation in the file system. This ultimately
        results in disk failure.
        <br>
    </p>

    <h5 style="margin: 5% 8% 0 8%">System and Network Abuse</h5>

    <p style="margin: 2% 8% 2% 8%">Email Disk Usage<br>
        Stacking large number of emails increases inodes and results in file system corruption. It also hinders various server level processes from functioning at normal load. Hence all mails has to be downloaded from the server then and there. Hosting accounts cannot be used as email storage space. Sites that use higher than this limit has to be upgraded to next available accounts such as corporate or semi dedicated account based on the usage. Failing to upgrade the account will result in suspension or termination of that particular website. Customer accounts such as personal, small biz and accounts under resellers can use disk space upto to 500 MB maximum including emails, website files, database etc.<br><br>
        Disk Space Usage<br>
        Customer accounts such as personal, small biz and accounts under resellers can use disk space upto to 500 MB maximum. Only files required for running of the website such as html,php etc can be hosted. Zip archives, downloads, videos, audio files and other software or warez downloads are strictly prohibited. Hosting space cannot be used for data storage or backup dumping. It cannot be used for file sharing, spam software downloads, software key downloads etc. Sites that use higher than this space limit has to be upgraded to next available accounts such as corporate or semi dedicated account based on the usage. Failing to upgrade the account will result in suspension or termination of that particular website. Any web site that uses a high amount of server resources (such as, but not limited to, CPU time, memory usage, and network resources, mail servers, Ftp servers, Http servers, SQL database servers) reserves the right to suspend that site immediately. This policy is only intended to prevent the misuse of our servers and to avoid interruption in services to other customers. Customers may be offered an option whereby Softech continues hosting the website for an additional fee or upgrade to a higher account. Softech will be the sole arbiter of what is considered to be a high server usage level. Any Web Hosting and E-Commerce account deemed to be adversely affecting server performance or network integrity will be suspended / terminated without prior notice.<br><br>
        The following are the list examples of activities that are not allowed to be hosted in any account;<br>
        Scripts running bots, spiders, port scanners, mail blasters Gaming servers, IRC relays Peer to Peer sharing, File sharing Calling include files as a URL rather than as a local file Running bit torrent applications, trackers A user may not exceed 20 % of total CPU usage for more than 100 seconds. Usually the reasons for such a spike in usage are poorly written php,cgi, perl or other scripts. If cron jobs are run, it must be scheduled at minimum of 15 min once and not less than that. Running MySql queries for more than 15 seconds is not allowed. Sites that attract DDOS attacks or automated attacks cannot be hosted in any of the accounts.
